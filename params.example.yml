# Parameters file for STARsolo or DRAGoN

# Parameters controlling file paths
IO:
  fastqdir: # REQUIRED: path to directory containing fastq files
  sampleName: # REQUIRED: regex prefix corresponding to fastq files for the plate currently being assessed
  bcldir: # Path to raw sequencer output. Required if fastq files need to be made.
  sampleSheet: # Path to bcl2fastq sample sheet. Required if fastq files need to be made.
  reference: # REQUIRED: igenome lookup key
  star: # REQUIRED if --IO.reference not passed: path to directory containing host genome indices
        # (STAR genome version 2.7.4a, should be built using the same --sjdbGTFfile as above, and a value of --sjdbOverhang appropriate for your experiment)
        # Passed to `STAR --genomeDir`.
  fasta: # full path of genome fasta file for building STAR indices as needed
  gtf: # full path of transcripts annotation GTF file for building STAR indices as needed
  barcodes: # REQUIRED: path to TSV describing barcodes/wells (minimum 2 columns)
  contaminant: # optional: path to directory containing contaminant genome indices
               # (STAR genome version 2.7.4a, optionally built with an --sjdbGTFfile for the contaminant species, and a value of --sjdbOverhang appropriate for your experiment)
  outdir: # REQUIRED: path to save output files

# Parameters for controlling filters and demultiplexing
Demux:
  dmuxn: 0 # Chunk size for demultiplexing, in number of read pairs (0: disable chunking)
           # If this step is timing out, consider setting it to something reasonable, i.e.
           # 50 million. Reduce as needed until it stops timing out.
           # Each chunk is one Demultiplex job. If chunking is disabled, spawns one
           # Demultiplex job for each fastq file pair.
  split: 0 # Group barcodes into at most this many STAR jobs.
           # (default: one job per barcode; noBC is always a separate job if IO.keep is yes)
  umilen: 10 # Length of the UMI. The implicit design of the R1 sequence has UMI starting
             # immediately after the barcode sequence, with the barcode sequence starting at
             # base position 0.
  mismatch: 2 # Maximum number of mismatches between sequenced barcode and design barcode.
              # The demultiplex process will verify that your design is complex enough
              # to support this argument setting, otherwise you may need to lower it.
  minLength: 20 # Minimum cDNA length to accept the read (after adaptor and quality trimming).
  minQuality: 20 # Minimum phred quality score to consider a base call as sufficient quality.
  minUmiQualBases: 6 # Minimum number of UMI bases that must meet or exceed minQuality.
  maxATcontent: 0.9 # Float maximum fraction of cDNA bases allowed to be A/T for QC pass.
  maxGCcontent: 0.9 # Float maximum fraction of cDNA bases allowed to be G/C for QC pass.
  homoPolymer: 10 # If a homopolymer (run of bases consisting of a single base)
                  # of at least this length is encountered, it and all downstream
                  # bases are removed. Set less than 5 to disable.
  maxHomoMmatch: 0 # Allow at most this many bases to differ from homopolymer to
                   # trigger removal.
  bcNcountMax: # Maximum number of N bases allowed in a barcode. If a barcode has more Ns
               # than this, the read is counted as noBC.

# Parameters for controlling the deduplication and counting step
Dedup:
  umi_mismatch: 2 # Maximum edit distance between two UMIs to collapse them into one.
                  # This includes substitutions and indels.
  umiDist: 10 # Size of the sliding window within a gene locus to consider
              # two UMIs to be the same. Uses genomic coordinates without
              # regard to splice junctions.
  ambiguous: Unique # Strategy for distributing multi-mapping UMIs across
                    # the genes they were assigned to.
                    # Options: Unique, Uniform, PropUnique, EM, Rescue.
                    # Behavior in DRAGoN is specified to mimic STARsolo.
